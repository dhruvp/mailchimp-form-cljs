# mailchimp-form-cljs
A simple mailchimp-esque form in clojurescript and reagent

This is inspired by Lukas Ruebbelke's awesome post on how to do the same thing in Angular here: http://onehungrymind.com/build-mailchimp-signup-form-angularjs/

Figured I'd give the same concept a shot in clojurescript to learn the language better and play around with reagent.

The blog post walking through this code is [here](http://dhruvp.github.io/2015/02/23/mailchimip-clojure/).
The demo is [here](http://dhruvp.github.io/mailchimp-form-cljs/).
