# mailchimp-form-cljs
A simple mailchimp-esque form in clojurescript and reagent

This is inspired by Lukas Ruebbelke's awesome post on how to do the same thing in Angular here: http://onehungrymind.com/build-mailchimp-signup-form-angularjs/

Figured I'd give the same concept a shot in clojurescript to learn the language better and play around with reagent.

I'll hopefully write a blogpost with my learnings soon!
